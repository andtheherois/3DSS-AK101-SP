		<text>The AK-101 Custom has been modified by technicins of the zone to enhance the charactersitsc of the original AK-101. The front guard rail, dust cover, and stock have all been upgraded for better accuracy and modularity when it comes to accessories.
		The muzzle device has also been replaced with one better suited to 5.56 rounds and as a result can also use a SOCOM supressor. Because the barrel is enclosed by the front guard, the "Guard" 30mm grenade launcher must be used instead of the standard GP-25 grenade launcher.\n \n </text>
